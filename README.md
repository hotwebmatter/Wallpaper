# Wallpaper
Fifth assignment to be submitted via Blackboard

## Objectives
Demonstrate usage of value-returning methods and void methods.

Note that the methods use their own (redundant) local variables for values.
Refactoring the Wallpaper class to get and set values of private data members
is beyond the scope of the current assignment. "Just the methods, ma'am."

I've refactored some void methods from earlier assignments to return values,
including RepeatChar() and CenterString(), along with the new IndentString().



## Example output
```
